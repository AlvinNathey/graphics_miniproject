  - **Downgrades**:  
    - **Red Rounded Downgrade**: Shrinks paddle size.  
  - **Dynamic Difficulty**:  
    - After every 5 points scored, the ball's speed increases, making the game progressively harder.

### **2. Timed Mode**  
- **Objective**: Survive and score as many points as possible within a time limit.  
- **Levels**:  
  - **Easy**: 10-minute timer.

- **Mechanics**:  
  - Timer adjusts dynamically with power-ups and downgrades:

    - **Red Rounded Downgrade**: Subtracts 10 seconds from the timer.  
  - **Dynamic Difficulty**:  
    - After every 5 points scored, the ball's speed increases, adding an extra layer of challenge.
